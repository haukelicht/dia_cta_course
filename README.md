# Introduction to computational text analysis for the DIA (DA Vienna)

This Github repository accompanies the DIA course "Introduction to computational text analysis" taught by Hauke Licht (hauke.licht@uibk.ac.at, University of Innsbruck) at the DA Vienna.

Participants must **complete the computer setup** described below during the first course block.


## Computer setup

### 1. Install/update R and RStudio

Participants must have running installations of the **_R_** programming languages and the **_RStudio_** integrated development environment (IDE) at the beginning of the course.

- Please follow the instructions at https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop to install R and RStudio.
- Verify that you have at least R 4.2.0 by running the following line in R(studio):
  ```R
  R.version[["version.string"]]
  ```
- Verify that you have at least RStudio version 2023.12 by running the following line in R(studio):
  ```R
  rstudioapi::versionInfo()$version
  ```
- To keep course materials up-to-date on your computer, you also require a **Git** installation (see [here](https://rfortherestofus.com/2021/02/how-to-use-git-github-with-r) and [here](https://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github.html)). A user-friendly option is using the [**_Github Desktop app_**](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-authenticating-to-github-desktop/installing-github-desktop) For alternatives, see [here](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git#install-git), incl. installation instructions. _Note @ Windows users_: I recommend using Github Desktop or [_Git for Windwows_](https://gitforwindows.org/).

Please contact the instructor (hauke.licht@uibk.ac.at) should you encounter issues or errors during setup.
