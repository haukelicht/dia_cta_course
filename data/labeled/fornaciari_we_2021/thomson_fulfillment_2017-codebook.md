## Operationalizing the Concept of “Election Pledge”: Theoretical and Methodological Issues

Each researcher in our group has carried out inter-coder reliability tests using coders in his or her own countries.
However, these country-level reliability tests did not quite address the comparative question: to what extent do we have the same operationalization of the concept of a pledge?
Here, we describe some of the process of making our data comparable and reliable across countries.
We believe that our work on conceptualizing and operationalizing election pledges has identified theoretical and methodological differences for future election-pledge scholars to take into account.
This appendix also clarifies how previously published country-specific studies differ when it comes to the operationalization of election pledges, differences that were not known to us before our comparative work started.

Our first coding exercise was performed using a portion of a manifesto from Ireland (2002 Fianna Fail: FF).
It was this exercise that alerted us to the fact that researchers in our group differed regarding their conceptualization and operationalization of election pledges, despite agreeing on the general approach.
Each person coded the manifesto according to his or her usual standards for coding.
Before the exercise, seven of the authors here participated in at least two workshops at which coding issues were discussed.
Even before this exercise, we recognized that there are a number of reasons why reliability across countries might not be as high as the results we found individually within each of our country studies.
First, it might be the case that the wording of manifestos varies based on political context.
It could be that parties that are more likely to have more control of policymaking will make pledges that commit to more definitive, specific actions.
So, the language of parties in countries that typically have single-party government may vary from those where coalitions are common, or where “divided government”, in which parties share power in a non-cooperative arrangement (e.g., the US), often occurs.
Coders who are used to one style of wording may find it difficult to consistently isolate pledges in programs with a different style.
Second, knowledge of current policy debates may matter for how a researcher codes pledges.
A statement may seem vague or incomprehensible to an outsider, whereas someone familiar with the context might recognize the language as referring to something specific.
It is often the case that certain terms or phrases come to have specific, non-obvious meanings in the policy world.
Finally, where coders are coding documents in a language that is not their first, all of these issues may be exacerbated.
Even someone who is fluent in the language may miss some of the subtle or complex meanings that can be part of an election program.

To evaluate reliability in the Irish manifesto exercise, we computed the simple percent agreement between each pair of coders.
This was computed as x/n for each pair, where x = the number of statements on which there is agreement between two coders (i.e., agreement that it is a pledge, or that it is not) and n=the total number of statements that were counted as pledges by the entire group.
The result was an average paired agreement of 67.5%.
The range of paired agreement rates was 45 – 87%.
Even taking into account our expectations of lower reliability for cross-national as opposed to within- nation tests, these results were low.
In our workshops, statement-by-statement discussion of our results showed that, in fact, there was variation in our definition and operationalization of the pledge concept.
We found that some coders counted only statements that were highly precise, some were quite generous in their consideration of what a pledge is, and some appeared to be somewhat in between the narrowest and broadest conceptualizations.

The narrowest definition of a pledge was that provided by Thomson (2001, 180): a pledge is a statement in for which “the criteria used to judge the fulfilment of pledges are... provided by the writers of election programmes, not by the researcher.”
This means that the statement must promise one specific course of action; pledges that could conceivably be fulfilled in multiple ways are excluded, as are pledges that might require interpretation on the part of the researcher on the relevant actions or outcomes to consider when evaluating fulfillment.

Reliability between two researchers who used this “narrow” definition was 77%, whereby the first researcher identified 24 pledges and the second 25 pledges.
Reliability between two researchers who followed the “broadest” definition was the highest, at 87%, whereby the first researcher identified 52 pledges and the second 51 pledges.
These researchers agreed that in addition to statements identified by those who followed the “narrow” definition, other types of statements can be pledges too.
This broader category includes statements that could be fulfilled by more than one course of action (for example, a pledge “to create opportunities for parents to return to work” might be fulfilled by either providing tax cuts for private childcare facilities or by creating more publicly funded childcare places).
This broader category also includes statements that might require interpretation on the part of the coder, either as to the meaning of the pledge, or the action or outcome that would need to occur to constitute fulfillment.
We refer to this as the “broad” definition.

Other coders identified more pledges than the two researchers who followed the narrow definition, but fewer than those who followed the broad definition, with a range of 32-39.
These coders generally included statements that could be fulfilled in more than one way, but were more cautious about including statements where more interpretation on the part of the coder was required.
Attempting to more clearly identify systematic differences between the narrow and broad approaches is a topic for future research.
For our present purposes, the important thing is that those using a broader approach can reliably identify a subcategory of narrow pledges.
To understand the differences in approaches, in particular, the difference between narrow pledges and others, examples are helpful.

### Different Definitions Illustrated

For the eight pledges below, there was unanimity among all coders that the statements constituted pledges: 
1. 
    > FF will continue to set aside … 1% of GNP to provide for future pension        obligations.
2.
    > We will establish … a new National Development Finance Agency.
3.
    > Keep  … those on low incomes and the minimum wage out of the tax net
4.
    > Achieving the situation where 80% of taxpayers pay only the standard rate
5.
    > Complete the reduction of the standard rate of corp. tax to 12.5% in 2003.
6.
    > Extend, on a permanent basis, the Employment Action Plan.
7.
    > The  … Small Business Task Force  … will be launched.
8.
    > We will ensure the putting in place of open-access broadband on a national basis (including rural communities).

These pledges fulfill the requirement of the narrow definition, namely, they pledge one specific action or outcome and interpretation of the meaning of the pledge and what constitutes fulfillment is unambiguous.

The statements below were not considered pledges by the researchers who followed the narrow definition, while all others coded them as pledges.
For each statement, we discuss the rationale that people gave in a post-coding exercise: 
1.
    > We will implement a comprehensive programme to expand the number of school pupils taking Science …
    - Narrow approach: Not considered a pledge because it is unclear what the program would consist of—for e.g., hiring more science teachers? Changing the curriculum?
    - Broad approach: The question to investigate would be: was a new program created for the purpose of increasing the number of science students, or not? There could be various ways of achieving this, like the examples above, or others.
    Any such new program to meet the aim would fulfill the pledge.
2.
    > We will drive forward our Schools IT programme …
    - Narrow approach: The statement is vague on the action being promised. What would the program consist of, and what would it mean to “drive it forward”?
    - Broad approach: “Schools IT programme” seems to refer to a specific program currently in existence. Research would be required to determine what it is; from there, research would determine what, if any, changes were made in the program while the government was in power. “Drive forward” is indeed ambiguous, but research would help determine how to interpret it. For example, it may be a new program at the time of the manifesto writing, and “drive forward” may simply refer to carrying it out as planned, making this a simple status quo pledge.

The following statements were not counted as pledges according to the researchers who followed the narrow definition, but divided opinion among those who followed a broader definition.
Some coders found these statements to be too broad to count as pledge, while others did not:

1.
    > We will continue to encourage …. A better spread of jobs throughout the country, and … we will provide the infrastructure to make regional locations more attractive … 
    (Note: some, but not most, divided this into 2 pledges).
    - Narrow approach: The aim of a “better spread of jobs” is too vague, and the action to achieve this is not specified. “Better” is especially vague, and could refer to a number of things. Regarding the second part of the statement: again, too vague. What kind of infrastructure? And how exactly will certain “regional locations” be made more attractive?
    - Broad approach: Research would be undertaken to determine: were there any government actions—legislative or otherwise—that were for the purpose of somehow encouraging a better spread of jobs throughout the country? Examples might be tax incentives for start-up companies in particular areas, or, since infrastructure is mentioned, proposals for improved transport to underserved parts of the country.
2.
    > We will continue to engage in active export promotion, especially in newer markets …
    - Narrow approach: It is not clear what specific activities would be required to promote such exports. Also, this could be taken as an outcomes pledge: to increase exports to newer markets. If so, the issue raised would be what are considered to be “new markets,” and, if exports are found to increase, whether it was an outcome of government action.
    - Broad approach: The pledge says “we will continue to”, and so should be read as a status quo pledge. Governments can have a variety of programs aimed at export promotion, and the pledge suggests this was true of Ireland at the time the pledge was made. It should not be difficult to determine what these programs are and whether they continued. If budget information for these programs could be obtained, then that could be used for determining fulfillment. Even if budgets were unavailable, simple evidence of these programs’ continued existence might constitute fulfillment of this status quo pledge.


### Theoretical Issues in the Operationalization of Pledges

The choice of how to operationalize the concept of pledge raises both theoretical and methodological considerations.
The broad vs. narrow approaches reflect different theoretical understandings of what it means for a party to make a “pledge”.
Those favoring the narrow definition believe that the mandate model of representative democracy is about parties that tell voters what they would do and how they would do it if they enter government office.
Since alternative policy instruments distribute costs and benefits differently, and moreover since citizens disagree about the effectiveness of alternative policy instruments, responsible parties must set out their plans in detail.
With imprecise promises, voters may choose a party expecting one thing, and find that they get another, while the government can plausibly deny that it broke its promise.

On the other hand, the broad approach assumes that promises can be made with varying degrees of precision, and yet accountability can still be maintained.
If a party pledges it will “take steps to promote x”, it might be the case that x could be promoted by a number of possible actions, such as direct government provision of a service, tax breaks for businesses, or tax breaks for individuals.
As long as any of these were done, the pledge would be fulfilled.
If a voter is disappointed because, say, tax breaks are offered rather than direct government provision, they may certainly be entitled to be disappointed—but not because the government broke its pledge.
In addition, some statements that appear ambiguous might be found, upon research, to have a specific meaning.
This can happen due to the fact that some messages in platforms are intended not for all of the voting public, but for particular groups, such as the party’s core supporters.
Language that may seem ambiguous may in fact have a specific meaning for key interest groups.
