    "- The _precision_ of approximately 0.788 indicates that when the model predicts a sentence as a pledge, it is correct about 78% of the time.\n",

    "- The ratio of precision to recall is approximately 1.13 and indicates that there is a slightly higher risk of false negatives compared to false positives. This means that the classifier is more likely to miss and actual pledge sentence than to incorrectly label a non-pledge sentence as a pledge.\n",
