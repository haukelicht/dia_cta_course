# Materials for block 2, day 1

In this folder you find the materials for day 1 of block 2 (fine-tuning transformer models).

Because your laptop might lack the necessary compute power to fine-tune transformer models, I recommend you run the notebooks in _Google Colab_.
For this, you need to

1. register a free Google account at https://colab.google/ (if you don't have one yet),
2. watch this introductory [short introduction video](https://youtu.be/RLYoEyIHL6A?si=yOohEqaqvdvSdKdV) if you have never worked with Google Colab before
3. in a given notebook, click on the "Open in Colab" badge at the top of the notebook.
